I want to make a database that has the history of my courses at the University.
The database support information about these courses as well as the instructors that taught them. This information can include:

-Course Name
-Course Year and Term
-Course Level

-Instructor Name
-Instructor email
-Instructor department

With information about the course documented, I'd also like to include any topics that I found the most intriguing from the class. I think that it would be nice to have data of all my classes with descriptions of my favorite topics and things I took away from each class the most. Also this is a project I can continually work for a while because is a lot of information from any given topic in a class. Information to include about topics:

-Topic name
-Topic description

Use Cases:
I could create a journalistic website for myself
I can use this to review classes that I took during college
