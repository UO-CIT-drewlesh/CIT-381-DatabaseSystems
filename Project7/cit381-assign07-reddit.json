We will also limit trade proposals and free agent posts based on their quality, relevance, and how frequently reoccurring the topic may be.\n\nWe do not allow these kinds of posts for several reasons, including, but not limited to: they encourage low-effort replies, pit players against each other, skew readers towards an us-vs-them mentality that inevitably leads to brash hyperbole and insults.\n\nWhat we want to see in our sub are well-considered analyses, well-supported opinions, and thoughtful replies that are open to listening to and learning from new perspectives.\n\n**We’d also like to address some common complaints we see in modmail:**\n\n1. *“Why me and not them?”* We will not discuss other users with you.\n2. *“They started it.”* Other people’s poor behavior does not excuse your own.\n3. *“My post was removed for not promoting discussion but it had lots of comments.”* Incorrect: It was removed for not promoting **serious** discussion. It had comments but they were mostly low-quality. Or your post asked a straightforward question that can be answered in one word or sentence, or by Googling it. Try posting in our weekly questions thread instead.\n4. *“My post met the minimum requirements and is high quality but was still removed.”* Use in-depth arguments to support your opinion. Our sub is looking for posts that dig deeper than the minimum, examining the full context of a player or coach or team, how they changed, grew, and adjusted throughout their career, including the quality of their opponents and cultural impact of their celebrity; how they affected and improved their teammates, responded to coaches, what strategies they employed for different situations and challenges. Etc.\n5. *“Why do posts/comments have a minimum character requirement? Why do you remove short posts and comments? Why don’t you let upvotes and downvotes decide?”* Our goal in this sub is to have a space for high-quality discussion. High-quality requires extra effort. Low-effort posts and comments are not only easier to write but to read, so even in a community where all the users are seeking high-quality, low-effort posts and comments will still garner more upvotes and more attention. If we allow low-effort posts and comments to remain, the community will gravitate towards them, pushing high-effort and high-quality posts and comments to the bottom. This encourages people to put in less effort. Removing them allows high-quality posts and comments to have space at the top, encouraging people to put in more effort in their own comments and posts.\n\nThere are still plenty of active NBA subs where users can enjoy making jokes or memes, or that welcome hot takes, and hyperbole (such as[ /r/NBATalk](https://www.reddit.com/r/NBATalk),[ /r/nbacirclejerk](https://www.reddit.com/r/nbacirclejerk), or[ /r/nba](https://www.reddit.com/r/nba)) . Ours is not one of them.\n\n**We expect thoughtful, patient, and considerate interactions in our community.** Hopefully this is the reason you are here. If you are new, please take some time to read over our rules and observe, and we welcome you to participate and contribute to the quality of our sub too!\n\nEDIT:\n\nOur mod u/RoundRajon34 would like to let everyone know that we have a new, **active Discord server** for users to continue their basketball (and other) discussions elsewhere with the offseason wrapping up ready for real games to start again.\n\nWhile the server follows most of the basic rules of this sub (e.g. keep it civil), it offers a place for more casual, live discussions (currently featuring daily hoopgrids competition), and we'd love to see more users getting involved over there as well. It includes channels for various topics such as game-threads for the new season, all-time discussions, analysis and draft/college discussions, as well as other sports such as NFL/college football and baseball.\n\nLink: [https://discord.gg/8mJYhrT5VZ](https://discord.gg/8mJYhrT5VZ) (let u/roundrajaon34 or other mods know if there are any issues with this link)\n\nHope to see many more of you there soon!\n\n\n\nEDIT 2:\n\n#We've added an In-Season Tournament Mega-Thread!\n\nWe receive an average of more than one in-season tournament proposal post a day. Instead of letting our sub become overrun by the same style post with one small tweak to make it unique, we're removing all individual posts about the in-season tournament and directing people to the mega-thread instead.

For some background I started refereeing 20+ years ago as a teenager and had ref'd youth Basketball and Soccer until about 2 years ago. It was never really about the money (at least not after I graduated college and got a real job) but I enjoyed it so I kept on doing it.  \n\nOf course, it wasn't always sunshine and roses. Crazy parents, troubled kids, etc are just something I learned to deal with over the years, but 90% of the time though people policed their own.  If a parent was acting up then some other parent on their side would step in.  If a player was playing dangerously or overly-aggressive the Coaches would step in and...well...coach.  Overall I would say that I would only have to do something drastic (eject a player, coach, or parent) once or twice a year.\n\nIn the last few years though, I saw a change.  A lot of people want to blame it on \"kids these days\" but that's not what it looked like from my perspective.  The kids were the same as always, kids will always push boundaries up until they get pushed back on by an authority figure...that's how they learn. And that's where I started to see the change.  Somewhere along the line, the mantra of coaches/parents taking responsibility for the actions of their kids got flipped on it's head.  More often than not the adults would just blindly defending their own kids.  \n\nAnd this takes me back to Kerr, and as an extension many of the modern \"players coaches\".  I get that it's hard to hold pro players accountable when they aren't kids and often are far less expendable to the franchise than you are. However just like the players are role models for young players, these coaches get propped up as examples for youth coaches.  So when Steve Kerr has his press conference where once again he pretends like Draymond did nothing wrong, that's how these youth coaches think they should behave.\n\nI don't think this is anything that's going to change, at least not anytime soon. And maybe I just sound like an old man yelling at clouds...or just some former ref bitching, but I wanted to just write my thoughts down and see if anyone may have experienced the same or similar.",

Draymonds fine I thought was roughly equal to 2 games salary - 25mill divided by 82 games - is that correct? Really curious to find out&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",

            "selftext": "RJ Barrett is off to a torrid start to the season, but he's had hot stretches before. Barrett is human confirmation bias: even now, in his best season, it’s easy to see precisely what you want to see in Barrett.\n\nHas he really taken a leap this year, or is it simply an earlier-than-usual Barrett heater? I decided to lay out the case for and against the New York Knick with help from Hopeful Hal and Grumpy Gus.\n\n\\[As always, I've included a bunch of illustrative video clips that you can [find in-context here](https://www.basketballpoetry.com/p/is-the-knicks-rj-barrett-tricking) or at the link in the comments. Thanks for reading!\\]\n\n**Hopeful Hal:** It’s easy to see that Barrett is markedly improved in his fifth year.\n\nBarrett is setting personal marks in points (22.6), assists (3.1), and three-point percentage (50%!) despite playing fewer minutes than he has since his rookie year. Lineups with Barrett have been in the [95th percentile leaguewide](https://cleaningtheglass.com/stats/player/4574/lineups#tab-four_factors) in both offensive and defensive rating; similarly, while on/off stats are unreliable this early in the year, it has to mean something that the team is useless on both ends when Barrett is off the court this season.\n\nThere could be a reason for his hot start from deep. Barrett reportedly changed his form over the summer, as analyzed [in excruciating detail by The Strickland](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfTGnI8WahM&amp;t=334s). Barrett shot 19/51, 37.3%, from the slightly closer FIBA three-point line — not quite his hot start to this season, but still an encouraging sign.\n\n**Grumpy Gus:** He was also just [6-for-21 from deep in the preseason](https://basketball.realgm.com/nba/teams/New-York-Knicks/20/Stats/2024/Totals/All/tpfga/All/desc/1/Preseason), and he’s been consistently below average throughout his career, so…\n\n**Hopeful Hal:** \\*coughs\\* It’s the preseason, man! And Barrett hasn’t been shooting unsustainably on closely-guarded shots, either. He’s only even attempted two triples that weren’t considered “open” or “wide open,” speaking to his wiser shot selection.\n\nHe’s become better at floating around on the three-point line to open up clean passing lanes from his teammates: \\[[video here](https://www.basketballpoetry.com/p/is-the-knicks-rj-barrett-tricking?utm_source=activity_item) or in comments\\]\n\nDefenses haven’t adjusted to his accuracy yet, and he’s making them pay with warm-up shots. It’s a win-win: either teams continue to ignore him on the perimeter, so he keeps getting easy looks, or they start guarding him tighter out there, opening up congested driving lanes.\n\nDespite that traffic, Barrett is finishing a career-best [61% of his shots at the rim and 41% from floater range](https://cleaningtheglass.com/stats/player/4574#tab-shooting_accuracy), and he is averaging a beastly 1.53 points per transition possession. His right hand looks better than ever, which is a low bar, but he’s looked better going in the devil’s direction, too.\n\nThis Knicks team doesn’t exactly provide Barrett a preponderance of space in which to operate. He’s consistently met by a wall of bodies in the paint, so the fact that he’s looked better operating in a crowd — and avoiding the crowd altogether — matters a great deal.\n\n**Grumpy Gus:** Those are all numbers, for sure. If we’re just spewing out stats, it’s worth noting that just 34% of his shots are at the rim, by far a career-low (although admittedly a solid number overall). That’s worked fine, thanks to his incendiary start to the season on threes. But that’s the sort of shift that can tank efficiency stats if the three-point percentage retreats too much.\n\nThat tick downward in rack attacks has also caused Barrett to draw fewer free throws — his 4.7 free throw attempts per game would be his fewest since the 2020-21 season.\n\n**Hopeful Hal:** You left out that he’s making a superb 84.8% of his free throws (and went 18-for-21 in the preseason, too!).\n\nBut free throws are boring to talk about. The most interesting part of Barrett’s improvement this season is that he’s clearly trying to make quicker decisions. His [2.65 seconds and 2.11 dribbles per touch](https://www.nba.com/stats/players/touches?CF=PLAYER_NAME*E*barrett&amp;Season=2023-24) are by far the lowest figures of his career. Interestingly, he never receives the ball on the elbows or in the paint. He’s entirely a perimeter player now, and he’s doing more with less.\n\nGus, if you don’t remember anything else from this conversation, remember this: his improvement isn’t in the number of “wow” plays; it’s in the lack of woeful ones. There are fewer record scratches, fewer possession-eating dribbles to nowhere.\n\nHe still sizes up the defense a tad too long. Nobody will ever accuse RJ Barrett of being a 0.5-second player. But he’s consistently making the simple passes he missed for so long, and like a magic carpet, it’s opened a whole new world for the Knicks’ offense.\n\n**Grumpy Gus:** Maybe that’s true, but it’s not like he’s creating major advantages with his playmaking: despite his slightly increased assist rate, his [potential assists are down](https://www.nba.com/stats/players/passing?CF=PLAYER_NAME*E*barrett&amp;Season=2022-23) from last year. This means his tiny uptick in assists is more likely due to teammate shooting luck than any intrinsic passing improvement.\n\nAnd for all that talk of improved decision-making, his pick-and-roll numbers aren’t great! In 44 P&amp;R possessions, Synergy says he’s only generating .818 points per possession, in the 23rd percentile. Those are way down from last year.\n\n**Hopeful Hal:** 44 possessions are barely worth looking at, and the eye test says that Barrett’s passing is better (do you even watch the games, Gus?). He’s showing a new command of the pick-and-roll, putting defenders on his back and consistently showing vision he rarely did before. Watch the patience here as Barrett waits for Isaiah Hartenstein to free up before delivering a nice little pocket pass: \\[[video here](https://www.basketballpoetry.com/p/is-the-knicks-rj-barrett-tricking?utm_source=activity_item) or in comments\\].\n\nThe Knicks have integrated a little more movement into Barrett’s role, too, and he’s been involved in more hand-offs than ever before (at the expense of spot-up opportunities). He’s taking and making right-handed layups, which is new, and his floater game is developing nicely. I’ll take a teardrop runner over driving in a straight line into the wall of defenders ignoring Julius Randle and flinging up an ugly lefty layup!\n\n**Grumpy Gus:** You know what I would take? A rebound. It would be great if Barrett didn’t consistently miss box-outs and deigned to grab a defensive board.\n\n**Hopeful Hal:** It’s still early, and that’ll stabilize. If you want to talk about regression, remember that Barrett has never averaged fewer than four defensive rebounds. I doubt he’ll start now (although, yes, the box-outs would be nice).\n\nDespite the lack of boards, Barrett’s defense has improved this season! RJ’s been better on the ball than ever before, and if not lockdown, certainly above-average. He has solid physical tools and is usually in the right spots at the right times. The team doesn’t hesitate to put him on elite wings — he credibly guarded Jayson Tatum ([allowing just 1-for-5 shooting](https://www.nba.com/stats/player/1629628/head-to-head?dir=D&amp;sort=SECONDS) as the closest defender) in their opening night matchup, and he also did well against Paul George and Brandon Ingram, among others. Here he is sticking with Tatum and forcing a difficult floater: \\[[video here](https://www.basketballpoetry.com/p/is-the-knicks-rj-barrett-tricking?utm_source=activity_item) or in comments\\]\n\nIt’s only been seven games, but it’s worth noting that his foul rate has been impossibly low — he’s only averaging 1.1 infractions per game. Foul avoidance is an underrated part of playing strong defense.\n\n**Grumpy Gus:** He never fouls because he never takes risks! Not to sound like a casual, but it would be nice if he’d make a defensive highlight at some point. Barrett remains one of the league’s least effective defensive playmakers — his [block and steal rates](https://cleaningtheglass.com/stats/player/4574#tab-defense_rebounding) are perpetually among the league’s worst, as [we talked about a bit here](https://www.basketballpoetry.com/p/haikus-and-more-2023-24-eastern-conference), and he only averages [1.1 deflections per game](https://www.nba.com/stats/players/hustle?CF=PLAYER_NAME*E*andre%20&amp;Season=2023-24). The Bucks’ rookie, Andre Jackson Jr., has averaged 1.3 deflections across his six games and only plays eight minutes per contest!\n\nWhile I concede his on-ball defense has been positionally solid, off the ball, he still looks like a man without a map. Watch him get so lost that he literally spins like a top while trying to find his elusive mark: \\[[video here](https://www.basketballpoetry.com/p/is-the-knicks-rj-barrett-tricking?utm_source=activity_item) or in comments\\]\n\nEven if the Knicks' defensive numbers look great when he’s on the court, that’s due primarily to teams shooting an [abysmal 29% from three](https://cleaningtheglass.com/stats/player/4574/lineups#tab-shooting_defense_fg) while Barrett’s out there. I doubt he’s single-handedly forcing opponents to shoot like my nephew’s grade-school team.\n\n**Hopeful Hal:** You have a nephew??? Anyway, you take what improvement you can get. This is perhaps the best Barrett has looked on that end and the first time I can confidently say he’s been a defensive asset overall.\n\nLook: we’re diving deep into the weeds without acknowledging that he’s been, to this point, consistent and reliable. He’s scored 24 or 26 points in five of his seven games, and the team is 5-2 when he plays (including a feisty season-opening loss to Boston). Some three-point regression is coming, for sure. But Barrett has looked like a new man since last year’s playoffs. While the shooting determines his ceiling, the defense determines his floor, and right now, his floor at least requires some stairs to reach.\n\nFinally, it’s worth remembering that Barrett is doing all this on a balky knee he tweaked in the first game of the season after a ferocious dunk. If that heals up, he could be even more effective around the rim and defensively.\n\n**Grumpy Gus:** Or it could linger all —.\n\n**Hopeful Hal:** I’m gonna stop you there. No bad juju today.\n\nIs Barrett for real this season? He isn’t going to be this good all year long, but there are genuine reasons to believe he’s made incremental improvements as a decision-maker and as an on-ball defender. We’ve already seen him shine in the playoffs, and he looks even better now. If the shooting touch stays solid, Barrett could become the third-best player on a contending team — if he’s not there already.\n\n**Grumpy Gus:** He’s not there already, and that’s a Garden-sized “if.” There’s a world of difference between Barrett ending up as, say, a 39% shooter from deep versus plateauing as a 35% shooter (which would still be the second-highest mark of his career, mind you). 39% opens up driving lanes for Barrett, Brunson, and Randle; 35% closes them off. How confident are you that he’s the former and not the latter?\n\n**Hopeful Hal:** I bet your nephew just loves you.",

The team doesn’t hesitate to put him on elite wings — he credibly guarded Jayson Tatum (&lt;a href=\"https://www.nba.com/stats/player/1629628/head-to-head?dir=D&amp;amp;sort=SECONDS\"&gt;allowing just 1-for-5 shooting&lt;/a&gt; as the closest defender) in their opening night matchup, and he also did well against Paul George and Brandon Ingram, among others. Here he is sticking with Tatum and forcing a difficult floater: [&lt;a href=\"https://www.basketballpoetry.com/p/is-the-knicks-rj-barrett-tricking?utm_source=activity_item\"&gt;video here&lt;/a&gt; or in comments]&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It’s only been seven games, but it’s worth noting that his foul rate has been impossibly low — he’s only averaging 1.1 infractions per game. Foul avoidance is an underrated part of playing strong defense.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Grumpy Gus:&lt;/strong&gt; He never fouls because he never takes risks! Not to sound like a casual, but it would be nice if he’d make a defensive highlight at some point. Barrett remains one of the league’s least effective defensive playmakers — his &lt;a href=\"https://cleaningtheglass.com/stats/player/4574#tab-defense_rebounding\"&gt;block and steal rates&lt;/a&gt; are perpetually among the league’s worst, as &lt;a href=\"https://www.basketballpoetry.com/p/haikus-and-more-2023-24-eastern-conference\"&gt;we talked about a bit here&lt;/a&gt;, and he only averages &lt;a href=\"https://www.nba.com/stats/players/hustle?CF=PLAYER_NAME*E*andre%20&amp;amp;Season=2023-24\"&gt;1.1 deflections per game&lt;/a&gt;. The Bucks’ rookie, Andre Jackson Jr., has averaged 1.3 deflections across his six games and only plays eight minutes per contest!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;While I concede his on-ball defense has been positionally solid, off the ball, he still looks like a man without a map. Watch him get so lost that he literally spins like a top while trying to find his elusive mark: [&lt;a href=\"https://www.basketballpoetry.com/p/is-the-knicks-rj-barrett-tricking?utm_source=activity_item\"&gt;video here&lt;/a&gt; or in comments]&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Even if the Knicks&amp;#39; defensive numbers look great when he’s on the court, that’s due primarily to teams shooting an &lt;a href=\"https://cleaningtheglass.com/stats/player/4574/lineups#tab-shooting_defense_fg\"&gt;abysmal 29% from three&lt;/a&gt; while Barrett’s out there. I doubt he’s single-handedly forcing opponents to shoot like my nephew’s grade-school team.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hopeful Hal:&lt;/strong&gt; You have a nephew??? Anyway, you take what improvement you can get. This is perhaps the best Barrett has looked on that end and the first time I can confidently say he’s been a defensive asset overall.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Look: we’re diving deep into the weeds without acknowledging that he’s been, to this point, consistent and reliable. He’s scored 24 or 26 points in five of his seven games, and the team is 5-2 when he plays (including a feisty season-opening loss to Boston). Some three-point regression is coming, for sure. But Barrett has looked like a new man since last year’s playoffs. While the shooting determines his ceiling, the defense determines his floor, and right now, his floor at least requires some stairs to reach.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Finally, it’s worth remembering that Barrett is doing all this on a balky knee he tweaked in the first game of the season after a ferocious dunk. If that heals up, he could be even more effective around the rim and defensively.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Grumpy Gus:&lt;/strong&gt; Or it could linger all —.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hopeful Hal:&lt;/strong&gt; I’m gonna stop you there. No bad juju today.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Is Barrett for real this season? He isn’t going to be this good all year long, but there are genuine reasons to believe he’s made incremental improvements as a decision-maker and as an on-ball defender. We’ve already seen him shine in the playoffs, and he looks even better now. If the shooting touch stays solid, Barrett could become the third-best player on a contending team — if he’s not there already.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Grumpy Gus:&lt;/strong&gt; He’s not there already, and that’s a Garden-sized “if.” There’s a world of difference between Barrett ending up as, say, a 39% shooter from deep versus plateauing as a 35% shooter (which would still be the second-highest mark of his career, mind you). 39% opens up driving lanes for Barrett, Brunson, and Randle; 35% closes them off. How confident are you that he’s the former and not the latter?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hopeful Hal:&lt;/strong&gt; I bet your nephew just loves you.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",

            "selftext": "\nI feel like this might be something that already exists but someone correct me if I’m wrong. \n\nMy idea is that the NBA develops a stat that shows, on average, how far from the center of the hoop each shot was, whether it went in or not. Say a player shoots 2 shots that go perfectly through the hoop in the most optimal spot possible, then his stat value for this could be, say, 100. However, if attempts stray from the center and land farther from the middle, the stat value would be lower. \n\nThe part I want to emphasize is that whether or not a shot goes in would not alter the stat value in any way. So a shot that takes a lucky bounce off the rim could theoretically have a lower value than a shot that looks pretty good but goes in and out and barely misses.\n\nIn terms of this stat’s possible importance, I’m mainly bringing over statistical strategies that I’ve seen used in baseball more over the years. One stat multiple front offices look into is exit velocity. Similar to what I have in mind, a higher exit velocity value doesn’t necessarily indicate a positive offensive outcome. You could hit a baseball 110 miles an hour off the bat and have it go right into a fielder’s glove, then hit a weak broken bat single your next at bat. \n\nBut you know what exit velocity does show? A positive correlation towards successful offensive outcomes. The higher the ball comes off the bat, the more likely the batter is to get a hit.\n\nCould this translate over to shooting a basketball? I want to make it clear that there are many nuances I am not accounting for, but I think it might be worth looking into if it can potentially highlight players capable of shooting at a consistent clip and separate “fluke” shooting percentages from those.\n\nAny thoughts? It’s a pretty underdeveloped idea but I’m curious to see if others think it might be applicable to a player’s shooting ability as well.\n\n(Side note– purely anecdotal, but I’ve noticed that a decent amount of Steph’s made threes look like they barely touch the net when they go through. I would figure that if this stat did exist, his would have to be one of the best all time.)",

However, if attempts stray from the center and land farther from the middle, the stat value would be lower. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The part I want to emphasize is that whether or not a shot goes in would not alter the stat value in any way. So a shot that takes a lucky bounce off the rim could theoretically have a lower value than a shot that looks pretty good but goes in and out and barely misses.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In terms of this stat’s possible importance, I’m mainly bringing over statistical strategies that I’ve seen used in baseball more over the years. One stat multiple front offices look into is exit velocity. Similar to what I have in mind, a higher exit velocity value doesn’t necessarily indicate a positive offensive outcome. You could hit a baseball 110 miles an hour off the bat and have it go right into a fielder’s glove, then hit a weak broken bat single your next at bat. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But you know what exit velocity does show? A positive correlation towards successful offensive outcomes. The higher the ball comes off the bat, the more likely the batter is to get a hit.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Could this translate over to shooting a basketball? I want to make it clear that there are many nuances I am not accounting for, but I think it might be worth looking into if it can potentially highlight players capable of shooting at a consistent clip and separate “fluke” shooting percentages from those.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Any thoughts? It’s a pretty underdeveloped idea but I’m curious to see if others think it might be applicable to a player’s shooting ability as well.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;(Side note– purely anecdotal, but I’ve noticed that a decent amount of Steph’s made threes look like they barely touch the net when they go through. I would figure that if this stat did exist, his would have to be one of the best all time.)&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",

Mon: 3 games, Tues: 5 games, etc.). This really just makes it easier for fans to follow throughout the week. Look at the NFL, everyone knows when to tune into games.\n\n- On a similar note, they should rebalance each weekday to have a similar number of games so there aren’t days with 2 games followed by a day with 13 games. And then on weekends have more games. The in season tournament shakes this up because of how many games are on Fridays.\n\n- Stagger game times in a better fashion, along with this, the NBA should start slates earlier at 6 pm EST instead of 7 pm EST. On 11/22/23, there is a 14 game slate with 5 games starting at 8:00 PM EST. There should be an even spread of games to increase viewership, instead of the current system you could start 2 games every 30 minutes starting from 6 PM.\n\nI know it’s not as simple as just scheduling a game at a stadium at any given time, cause of time conflicts at the stadium. But for nearly all arenas, outside those splitting with a hockey team or another basketball team. Basketball is their main event and schedules should be able to permit. These schedules could also be planned out years in advance. Overall, I think these changes can help with viewership and with fan creation by allowing people to be able watch more NBA games over the course of a season. I think this would also eliminate scheduling advantages and put all teams on a more even slate.\n\nWhat do you guys think of how the NBA is currently scheduled?",

Between Kawhi, PG, Harden, and what&amp;#39;s left of Russ, they should be decent. And an almost identical roster, minus Marcus Morris, RoCo, Batum, and KJ Martin was 3-2 with some decent wins. Can someone who&amp;#39;s been watching tell me if Harden is really dragging them down that much? Or is the issue somewhere else?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",

            "selftext": "In order to make the NBA regular season substantially more exciting, this is an idea that expands the concept of in-season tournament with a temporary, in-season \"relegation and succession\" system (without the major downsides of making separate leagues) with an expanded league.\n\nThis NBA has 36 teams and three \"classes,\" A, B and C.\n\n**Part 1: The Classing Tournament \\[10 games\\]**\n\nThe season starts with the Classing Tournament, which determines what class you will start out in. Teams are divided into six relatively equally distributed groups of six based on the previous season's final ranking (or, if you want to make it interesting, team salaries). Every team plays home and away vs. the other five teams in their group \\[10 games\\]. There are no knockout games, just group play and record is determined based on tiebreakers.\n\n\\- The top team in each group and the next six best records become Class A.\n\n\\- The middle 12 records become Class B.\n\n\\- The bottom 12 records become Class C.\n\n**Part 2: Class Play I**\n\nEach group plays the other 11 teams in their group twice, home and away (22 games).\n\n**Part 3: Midseason Tournaments**\n\nNow it is time for the Midseason tournaments. \\[16-19 games\\] The league divides into 4 groups of 9 based upon records in Class Play I. Each tournament is formatted the same: each team plays each other home and away \\[16 games\\] followed by quarters, semis and finals. \n\nFollowing the midseason tournaments, Class A and Class B now each have 14 teams and Class C has 8.\n\n1. *The Elite Cup*: 1st - top 6 records in Class A, top 2 in Class B, and 1st in Class C. All nine teams are automatically in Class A for the next segment of the season. The winner of the tournament gets +3 bonus wins for the next (playoff-determinant) segment of group play, the runner up +2 and the semifinalists +1.\n2. *The Silver Tournament*: The 7th - 9th best records in Class A, the 3rd, 4th and 5th place teams in Class B and the 2nd and 3rd place teams in Class C compete for 4 slots in the expanded Class A. All semifinalists qualify for Class A. The other 5 teams are in Group B.\n3. *The Bronze Tournament*: The 10th and 11th place teams in Class A, the 4th - 8th place teams in Class B and 4th through 5th place teams in Class C compete. The tournament winner gets the last Class A spot. The other 8 teams end up in Group B.\n4. *The Pewter Tournament*: The last place team of Class A, the bottom 2 teams of Class B, the bottom 7 teams of Class C compete for the last slot in Group B. The other 8 teams are in Class C.\n\n**Part 4: Class Play II (26 games)**\n\nFollowing the Midseason tournaments, other than the bonus wins from the Elite Cup, all records \"reset\" to zero for Class Play II. The new expanded Classes A and B play every team in their class home and away. Group C plays each other 3-4 times.\n\n**Part 5: End of Season Tournaments: Seeding Tournament, Play-In Tournament and Consolation Tournament**\n\nThe top 7 record teams in Class A and the winner of Class B based on Class Play II qualify for the playoffs.  They play a mini-tournament against each other for seeding while the Play-In tournament proceeds.\n\nThe remaining 7 teams in Class A enter the Play-In Tournament \\[25 games\\] against the 2nd-8th place teams in Class B's Class Play II and the best record of Class C. They divide into 4 groups of 4 for qualifiers \\[6 games each, home and away\\]. Group winners and the next best 4 records in the play-in tournament make the playoffs.\n\nThe 20 teams that did not qualify for either the playoffs or the play-in play a one-and-done tournament. The team that wins the tournament gets a guaranteed top 10 pick in the following draft, even if they don't have a pick.\n\nIf I have summed it correctly, this would put the maximum number of games in a regular season to a minimum of 75 games (not qualifying for knockouts in midseason tournaments, knocked out early in consolation tournament) and a maximum of 83 games (including up to 3 knockout games in the midseason tournaments).\n\nPros:\n\n* It gives the excitement of a relegation and succession system in-season without devaluing franchises by actually creating separate leagues or affecting the following season.\n* It makes the regular season constantly exciting since the season is on the line in any given stretch. Right off the bat, the first tournament has massive implications for playoff chances since Group A gets somewhat preferential treatment going forward even though they have a more difficult level of competition they have to play up to.\n* It gives a practical route to expanding the league from 30 to 36 teams, which expands revenues.\n\nCons:\n\n* Because win-loss record no longer matters (a team that stays in Class A for a whole season would likely be playing a substantially harder SOS than a team in Class C for the whole season), the draft will have to be re-structured around something other than record. It will also mean stats will come with an asterisk since the levels of competition between Classes are different.\n* If a team has bad timing during one of the tournaments (injury to star, for instance) it could drastically impact the season outcome even if you have a great season overall. There are constant opportunities for redemption, however.\n* The NBA could not schedule the whole season in advance - they would have to schedule each of the five sections of regular season piecemeal. This may be the biggest logistical catch.",

The other 8 teams are in Class C.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ol&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Part 4: Class Play II (26 games)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Following the Midseason tournaments, other than the bonus wins from the Elite Cup, all records &amp;quot;reset&amp;quot; to zero for Class Play II. The new expanded Classes A and B play every team in their class home and away. Group C plays each other 3-4 times.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Part 5: End of Season Tournaments: Seeding Tournament, Play-In Tournament and Consolation Tournament&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The top 7 record teams in Class A and the winner of Class B based on Class Play II qualify for the playoffs.  They play a mini-tournament against each other for seeding while the Play-In tournament proceeds.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The remaining 7 teams in Class A enter the Play-In Tournament [25 games] against the 2nd-8th place teams in Class B&amp;#39;s Class Play II and the best record of Class C. They divide into 4 groups of 4 for qualifiers [6 games each, home and away]. Group winners and the next best 4 records in the play-in tournament make the playoffs.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The 20 teams that did not qualify for either the playoffs or the play-in play a one-and-done tournament. The team that wins the tournament gets a guaranteed top 10 pick in the following draft, even if they don&amp;#39;t have a pick.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If I have summed it correctly, this would put the maximum number of games in a regular season to a minimum of 75 games (not qualifying for knockouts in midseason tournaments, knocked out early in consolation tournament) and a maximum of 83 games (including up to 3 knockout games in the midseason tournaments).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Pros:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;It gives the excitement of a relegation and succession system in-season without devaluing franchises by actually creating separate leagues or affecting the following season.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;It makes the regular season constantly exciting since the season is on the line in any given stretch. Right off the bat, the first tournament has massive implications for playoff chances since Group A gets somewhat preferential treatment going forward even though they have a more difficult level of competition they have to play up to.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;It gives a practical route to expanding the league from 30 to 36 teams, which expands revenues.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Cons:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Because win-loss record no longer matters (a team that stays in Class A for a whole season would likely be playing a substantially harder SOS than a team in Class C for the whole season), the draft will have to be re-structured around something other than record. It will also mean stats will come with an asterisk since the levels of competition between Classes are different.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;If a team has bad timing during one of the tournaments (injury to star, for instance) it could drastically impact the season outcome even if you have a great season overall. There are constant opportunities for redemption, however.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;The NBA could not schedule the whole season in advance - they would have to schedule each of the five sections of regular season piecemeal. This may be the biggest logistical catch.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",

Although players like Zach LaVine, DeMar DeRozan, and Nikola Vucevic have been the highlights of potential trades, I am personally interested about Alex Caruso's value on the trade market. Although he isn't an all-star caliber player who puts up 25 a night, he is one of the best defenders in all of the NBA. Already this season he has had two (arguably more) fantastic defensive games vs the Phoenix Suns (Absolutely shutting down Kevin Durant in the 4th) and Toronto Raptors ( with a Game-winning steal on Pascal Siakam and then hitting a 3 on the other end to ice the game). His stats on the season are 1.6 steals per game and 0.8 blocks per game with a 111.8 defensive rating (the Bulls without Caruso on the floor are 115.8)! Assuming the Bulls blow it ALL up, I wouldn't be surprised to see him go for 2 first-round picks (slightly protected) to a contending team as he is one of the best role players for his contract (9 million a year, 2 years left on his deal).\n\nMore info on Alex Caruso\n\n* Lead all guards in defensive LEBRON\n* All-NBA defensive first-team rcentage allowed as a defender\n* All-NBA defensive first team \n* Offensively he is scoring 7.8 points a game on 59% from the field and 44% from three (Isn't sustainable but is quite interesting non-the-less)\n* Listed at 6'5 with around the same wingspan (6'5.5), slightly taller than most guards\n\nIn a hypothetical scenario with the Bulls blowing it all up, he could have the most value on any potential trade package due to his team-friendly contract and defensive giftedness.

            "selftext": "With how often BBIQ gets thrown around in pre-draft scouting reports, it's pretty clear that teams consider it an important factor in their evaluation of players, but to me, it feels like they're constantly measuring it in the wrong way. Often reporters and scouts will often assume because a guy has a large vocabulary or is able to articulate himself well, it means that he'll be able to learn NBA-level offence/defence. Prospects like Bamba and Wiseman embody this.\n\nI remember reporters gushing about how Bamba was a joy to talk to and how engaging and he was. Even though they were somewhat hyperbolic, similar reports came out about Wiseman. These guys have been in the league for quite some time and people still describe them as looking \"lost\" and always being a few steps behind the play. Someone's verbal abilities are probably the easiest to get a grasp of but I suspect that prospects like Wiseman, probably lack the spatial reasoning, memory and processing speed of those players people describe as \"always being in the right place at the right time\". I'm not saying they're dumb. I'm suggesting that these abilities may be perfectly fine for the average person but, they might be awful relative to the average player in the league.\n\nI'm sure LeBron's BBIQ is much less mystical than we imagine and is simply a combination of his long term memory (recalling plays he's seen before), working memory (not forgetting the short term game plan and areas of focus) and ability to process visual information quicker than anybody else on the floor. The fact that he's athletic enough to make act on these plays makes him unstoppable. Off the court, he gets made fun of for his poor speaking/reading skills. To me these can almost certainly be attributed to attending poor schools in his early years. In terms of other cognitive abilities, the average person probably looks pathetic in comparison to him.\n\nIn short, I think a couple of tests measuring memory, spatial reasoning, processing speed and ability to focus, could be more effective in picking out players who might be obvious busts or identifying hidden gems in the late lottery and beyond. Players probably wouldn't willingly take these tests and I'm sure the NBPA would also have issues with it but, I think it could have some merits.",

            "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;With how often BBIQ gets thrown around in pre-draft scouting reports, it&amp;#39;s pretty clear that teams consider it an important factor in their evaluation of players, but to me, it feels like they&amp;#39;re constantly measuring it in the wrong way. Often reporters and scouts will often assume because a guy has a large vocabulary or is able to articulate himself well, it means that he&amp;#39;ll be able to learn NBA-level offence/defence. Prospects like Bamba and Wiseman embody this.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I remember reporters gushing about how Bamba was a joy to talk to and how engaging and he was. Even though they were somewhat hyperbolic, similar reports came out about Wiseman. These guys have been in the league for quite some time and people still describe them as looking &amp;quot;lost&amp;quot; and always being a few steps behind the play. Someone&amp;#39;s verbal abilities are probably the easiest to get a grasp of but I suspect that prospects like Wiseman, probably lack the spatial reasoning, memory and processing speed of those players people describe as &amp;quot;always being in the right place at the right time&amp;quot;. I&amp;#39;m not saying they&amp;#39;re dumb. I&amp;#39;m suggesting that these abilities may be perfectly fine for the average person but, they might be awful relative to the average player in the league.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m sure LeBron&amp;#39;s BBIQ is much less mystical than we imagine and is simply a combination of his long term memory (recalling plays he&amp;#39;s seen before), working memory (not forgetting the short term game plan and areas of focus) and ability to process visual information quicker than anybody else on the floor. The fact that he&amp;#39;s athletic enough to make act on these plays makes him unstoppable. Off the court, he gets made fun of for his poor speaking/reading skills. To me these can almost certainly be attributed to attending poor schools in his early years. In terms of other cognitive abilities, the average person probably looks pathetic in comparison to him.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In short, I think a couple of tests measuring memory, spatial reasoning, processing speed and ability to focus, could be more effective in picking out players who might be obvious busts or identifying hidden gems in the late lottery and beyond. Players probably wouldn&amp;#39;t willingly take these tests and I&amp;#39;m sure the NBPA would also have issues with it but, I think it could have some merits.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",

All of the guys mentioned above aside from Cole Anthony and Jett Howard are capable of defending at least 3 positions, and almost all of them are high-IQ players.

They're shooting 33, 30 and 30% respectively and Black started the season 5/9.\n\nThe core also somewhat reminds me of the Celtics last season. Jalen Suggs is like Marcus Smart (Energetic defensive specialist who can pass and somewhat shoot), Wendell Carter is like Al Horford (Stretch 5 who can pass and is an excellent defender), Cole Anthony is like Malcolm Brogdon (Offensive-focused guard who can shoot the lights out but isn't the best on defense), Jonathan Issac is like Robert Williams (Scary as a low-man and an incredible defensive presence but is ALWAYS injured), and are both lead by two forward with size (The two J's / Franz and Paolo). We've seen what the C's had done with that core, and the Magic have even more depth with Markelle Fultz, Jett Howard (Who's somewhat Sam Hauser-esque), Mo Wagner, Gary Harris, Joe Ingles, Mo Wagner...\n\nI think the NBA has transitioned from complete small-ball to position-less ball with huge guards and small centers. (Even the small-ball Warriors features big wings like the 6'6\" Andre Iguodala, 6'6\" Klay Thompson, 6'7\" Andrew Wiggins, 6'8\" Harrison Barnes, 6'10\" Kevin Durant, etc) The Thunder are the perfect example, filling the court with multiple 6'4-6'8 guards and wings.\n\nI think the Magic still has a ton of untapped potential with a healthy Jonathan Issac, Jalen Suggs improving and Anthony Black being in his rookie season, and if they could remain healthy (Which is a BIG if), in a few years they will be a force to reckon with in the east.",

However, we're now in year 3 for Mobley and his offensive game has seemed to stagnate. Once again, his 3pt percentage is below 25%, and the FT% has remained in the same 65-70% mark that it has been since college. He also still seems inconsistent in creating his own shot. How worried should the Cavs be that Mobley is not developing into the offensive player they thought he could be? In addition, if Mobley's offensive game never fully develops and he cannot space the floor, how do the Cavs move forward with their roster construction?\n\nMy personal opinion so I'm following the sub rules....\n\nFor the first question, I don't think it's time to fully raise the alarm bells since some players just take longer to develop the offensive side of their game. However, I do think it's time for the Cavs to seriously consider the possibility that Mobley never becomes a floor spacer or go-to scorer, and begin thinking of contingency plans for how to pivot in their roster construction/coaching philosophy. As for the second question, using other NBA rosters as an example, I think there are really two ways to accommodate a PF that cannot shoot the ball which the Cavs could emulate. The first example is the Bucks with Giannis, and the answer is pretty simple in that they need to acquire a stretch 5. That means that Allen would need to be moved for someone like Evan Turner, however this is always a difficult path to go down, as stretch 5s are extremely rare. The other example is moving to a Warriors-style motion offense where Mobley assumes the Draymond Green role. This doesn't require a major roster change, but definitely requires a major schematic change that could be paired with a new coach. If JB Bickerstaff continues to underwhelm, perhaps the Cavs make a move for someone like Kenny Atkinson or Jordi Fernandez. I think this path takes advantage of Mobley's passing skillset well, but I'm not sure if its the best way to utilize Darius Garland as it takes the ball out of his hands more. Overall, I like the stretch 5 path more but it just requires the Cavs to find that type of player which is extremely difficult.",

What I find interesting about these guys is that some started as first or second options and could never really put things together in these situations until adjusting to a different role on a contender (Andrew Wiggins and Aaron Gordon are two names that come to mind). Both have really improved as defenders and saw their efficiency numbers rise in their new situations. NBA team have really started to value these types of players considerably. I especially think that with the roster makeup style we’ve seen from recent NBA champions—as well as the issues that have come with many underachieving super teams over the years—we might be seeing more and more teams attempting to build contending rosters differently in the near future. What do you guys think? Is the superteam era ending soon?",

What I find interesting about these guys is that some started as first or second options and could never really put things together in these situations until adjusting to a different role on a contender (Andrew Wiggins and Aaron Gordon are two names that come to mind). Both have really improved as defenders and saw their efficiency numbers rise in their new situations. NBA team have really started to value these types of players considerably. I especially think that with the roster makeup style we’ve seen from recent NBA champions—as well as the issues that have come with many underachieving super teams over the years—we might be seeing more and more teams attempting to build contending rosters differently in the near future. What do you guys think? Is the superteam era ending soon?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
